Finance describes the management, creation and study of money, banking, credit, investments, assets and liabilities that make up financial systems, as well as the study of those financial instruments.
Some people prefer to divide finance into three distinct categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
There is also the recently emerging area of social finance.
Additionally, the study of behavioral finance aims to learn about the more "human" side of a science considered by most to be highly mathematical.
