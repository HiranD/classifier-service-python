When feelings become severe, won’t go away, or limit your ability to stay healthy and carry out typical functions in your life, it’s important to get help.
Changes to your mental health that may indicate that you need help include:
No longer finding enjoyment in activities that usually make you happy
Experiencing persistent sadness or feeling empty
Feeling anxious or stressed
Having suicidal thoughts
Mental health conditions can sometimes lead to alcohol or drug use.
Talk to your doctor if you are having any problems with alcohol or drugs.
